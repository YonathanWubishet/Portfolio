Goals and Dreams

I enjoy coding C++ desktop applications for personal projects, and I have always wanted to further advance my coding skills by training on additional coding languages.

In fact, whle my background is in Network and System Admin, it is my dream to work on Web development and Software development as well.

I look forward to a career in web Development after my Ruby on Rails Web Development training with SnapIT.
