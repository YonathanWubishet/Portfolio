Skills and Experience

Since leaving Centriq, I have worked in three Technical Support and Help Desk 
contract positions where I have further developed my IT support skills. 

In those roles, I have worked on troubleshooting Microsoft applications and 
Systems along with managing user accounts in Active Directory and Exchange server. 

I also got to work on troubleshooting Data Management Systems such as iManage, 
secure remote access tools such as Cisco VPN, and virtual desktop environements such as
Citrix and other IT tools and systems.
